#  Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO)

##  Overview
Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO) allows FortiGate to identify users based on their Active Directory login.  
Instead of using only IPs, firewall policies can use **users & groups** directly from AD.

This enables **identity-based security** across HQ and branches.

---

##  Purpose in the Project
- Allow firewall rules based on **AD user or group**
- Track users by name in firewall logs
- Apply different internet policies per department (HR, Sales, Finance…)
- Automatically detect login/logout events
- Integrate AD → ISE → FortiGate

---

##  How FSSO Works
1. A user logs into Windows → AD authenticates them  
2. The Domain Controller forwards login information to FortiGate  
3. FortiGate binds **username ↔ IP address**  
4. Policies apply based on user identity instead of just IP

---

##  Configuration Summary
### On the Domain Controller
- Install **FSSO Agent** or enable LDAP/NTLM authentication  
- Allow event logs for login & logout tracking

### On the FortiGate
- Configure LDAP connection to AD  
- Enable FSSO under User Directory  
- Import AD Groups:
  - HR
  - Sales
  - Finance
  - Media
  - IT Admins

##  Identity-Based Firewall Policies
Example:

| AD Group | Policy | Internet Access |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| HR | HR Policy | Normal restriction |
| Sales | Sales Policy | Full internet |
| Finance | Finance Policy | High security |
| IT | Admin Policy | Unrestricted |

---

##  Testing
- User logs into Windows → appears in FortiGate as **"user@corp.local"**  
- Firewall policy changes based on user group  
- Logs show username instead of IP  
- Internet browsing blocked/allowed depending on identity

---

##  Result
FSSO ensures identity-aware security and gives full visibility over users across HQ and branches.
