🌐 Enterprise Network Infrastructure – DEPI Project 🚀
📌 Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a secure, scalable, and highly available Enterprise Network Infrastructure. It simulates a real-world multi-department organization, integrating advanced networking concepts to ensure redundancy, security, branch connectivity, and cloud integration.

The design leverages FortiGate Firewall, VLAN segmentation, DMZ hosting, VPN tunnels, and EtherChannel redundancy to deliver a robust solution that reflects industry-standard enterprise networks.

🔹 Project Scope

Connect multiple departments and branches into one cohesive enterprise infrastructure.

Implement redundancy at both Layer 2 and Layer 3.

Secure traffic with FortiGate firewall policies and DMZ isolation.

Provide remote and branch connectivity using VPN technologies.

Enable enterprise services including DHCP, Syslog, NTP, and server hosting.

Support future scalability with Cloud service integration.

🖧 Network Design Highlights
🔄 Redundancy & Availability

EtherChannel (LACP) for load balancing and fault tolerance.

Redundant links between distribution and core layers.

📡 VLANs & Subnetting

Departmental segmentation using VLANs.

Efficient IP subnetting for structured address management.

🔒 Security Architecture

FortiGate Firewall as the central security gateway.

DMZ deployment for critical servers (Web, Syslog, DHCP).

Security policies enforcing controlled access to services.

🌍 Connectivity

VPN tunnels for secure inter-branch communication.

Default route propagation for Internet access.

NAT/PAT for external connectivity.

Cloud integration for scalable enterprise services.

⚙ Network Services

Windows Server 2016 providing enterprise-level services.

DHCP with relay for centralized IP allocation.

Syslog server for centralized logging and monitoring.

NTP server for synchronized time across devices.
