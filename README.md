# üìå Project Scope ‚Äì Enterprise Network Infrastructure

## üéØ Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a **secure, scalable, and highly available enterprise network** that connects multiple departments and branches under a unified infrastructure.

## üè¢ Scope of Work
- Design a hierarchical enterprise network with Core, Distribution, and Access layers.
- Implement **VLANs and subnetting** for departmental segmentation and efficient IP allocation.
- Deploy a **FortiGate Firewall** to enforce enterprise-wide security policies.
- Configure a **DMZ** for hosting critical servers and services.
- Establish **VPN tunnels** using **IPSec** for secure remote and branch connectivity.
- Integrate **Cloud services** to enhance scalability and flexibility.
- Configure **OSPF (Area 0 Backbone)** to connect HQ and Branch networks.
- Implement **HSRP** for Layer 3 redundancy and **MSTP** for loop prevention.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables
- Complete network topology diagram.
- Device configurations (Switches, Routers, FortiGate).
- Documentation of VLANs, IP addressing, and subnetting plan.
- Security policy definitions and firewall configurations.
- VPN configuration details with IPSec parameters.
- High availability plan (HSRP + EtherChannel).
- Connectivity test results (ping, ACL, VPN).
